# 0.9.1

Version 0.9.1 is the second beta release, addressing and resolving several issues from the initial 0.9.0 version. Changes and additions include:

* The requirement to include "http://" or "https://" at the start of the host has been eliminated. In the new update, you can simply check the "Secure" box.
* The "Compile as DLL" option has been concealed due to concerns of potential misuse. It's important to be aware that this option is presently non-functional. The reason behind this is that the RAT necessitates a DLL to be located in the same folder as the compiled DLL, and enabling this feature will cause the DLL to fail in connecting to the server.
* The "Hidden Task" option has been added to conceal the Console Window in the compiled EXE. This enables the generation of Test Stubs with a shown/hidden console.
* Operating System information display has been fixed to accurately reflect the operating system, such as "Microsoft Windows 11 Pro - 64-bit."
* A notification option has been included for user connection alerts.
* Port modification is now possible within the settings.
* A sending issue has been resolved, allowing communication with computers that aren't your own.
* The "Test Connection" option is now available in the settings.
